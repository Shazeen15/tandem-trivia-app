## How to Use the App
[Load the site.](https://tandem-trivia.herokuapp.com/)

The first thing that will show is the first question.
I am planning on adding a start button as the innital page instead of the first questions later on 

### Features I am having difficulty with
- [x] Adding a next Button
- [ ] Add a start Button
- [ ] I want my next button to hide until the user clicks on an answer and then dissappears when the next question appears.
- [ ] Displaying the correct answer when the user click on the answer buttons
- [ ] My button wont highligh until the second click
- [ ] My button stay highlighted when the next question appears
